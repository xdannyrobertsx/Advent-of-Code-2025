### Advent of Code 2025

---
###### 2025-12-01
```
this is my attempt at advent of code 2025 using only neovim, deno, and typescript.
it's my second year doing it and i'm nervous to see how much better or worse i've gotten now that I use AI as much as i do for work stuff.

the rules haven't changed and are still pretty explicit about not using AI - so it's good practice to see how sharp (or not) i feel solving some of these problems!

dunno that anyone will read this, but i wanted to write it for myself, if no one else.
i'll (hopefully) update this file at the end of the month!
